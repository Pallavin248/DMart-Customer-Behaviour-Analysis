# From Cart to Counter â€” Consumer Behaviour & Churn Analysis at DMart

This repository contains an applied statistics + machine learning project analyzing **customer shopping behaviour** at DMart.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, churn-prediction modeling, market-basket analysis, classification of shopping preference, and visualization of results.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data cleaning and feature engineering for survey & transactional data  
- Chi-Square tests for demographic association with spending  
- Logistic Regression (and robust checks) for churn prediction  
- Random Forest & KNN for classifying In-store vs Online preference (with SMOTE)  
- Market Basket Analysis (Apriori + association rules) to find frequently-bought itemsets  
- Factor Analysis (KMO, Bartlett, Varimax) to extract latent factors  
- Pareto analysis to prioritize improvements (80/20)  
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step reproducibility  
- Exportable results (plots, tables, and model artifacts)
